# [4-Year Approximate Value of Drafted NFL Player](https://werlindo.com/DDP/slides/index.html#/slide-1)

## Predict First 4 Years of Accumulated AV for a Drafted NFL Player.

- National Football League teams (American Football) have an annual draft of college players
- How can teams maximize the value they get out of their draft picks?
- [Approximate Value](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/index37a8.html) is a metric that estimates the relative seasonal value of an NFL player at any position from any year
- Multiple linear regression to predict Approximate Value of a player
- Chose 4 years because that essentially most drafted players are under team control for the first 4 years after being drafted

### Update: 2022.02
I'm in the process of updating and cleaning up the slides, but looks like some
of the tools I used (e.g. slidify) before have been deprecated. I'm looking into
using R Presentation (which is also 'knits' to an HTML5 product) is a viable 
alternative; see branch **cloud** (I'm using RStudio cloud for this mini-update
project).
